# Matplotlib

Matplotlib makes graphs. There is a great [matplotlib tutorial](https://thepythoncodingbook.com/basics-of-data-visualisation-in-python-using-matplotlib/) about using matplotlib to create graphs. We are going to look at just a few of its examples. Feel free to go through the rest of it at your own pace if you want to learn more about matplotlib.
