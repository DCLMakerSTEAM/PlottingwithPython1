# Python introduction

Most Python visualization programs follow the same pattern:
* Read in some data
* Loop over each record in that data, collecting values of interest
* Skip records that are not of interest
* Configure the visualization (colors, labels, etc.)
* Display the visualization

Key things to understand:
* Variables
  * x = 4
  * y = x+1
  * What does y equal?
* Loops
  * Do something for every record in my data
* Conditionals
  * Sometimes you don't want to do something for EVERY record
  * Do something ONLY if this condition is met
