# Python introduction

Python is the most popular language for data visualization. It has a very rich set of tools and documentation. For this class you do not need to write any Python code. ChatGPT will write code for you. But, you may run into problems. To ask ChatGPT to solve the problems for you it might be useful to have a basic feel for what code looks like.

Most Python visualization programs follow the same pattern:
* Read in the data from a CSV file (or similar)
* Loop over each row in the data
  * Skip records that are not of interest
* Configure the visualization (colors, labels, etc.)
* Display the visualization or save it to a file

Key programming concepts to understand:
* Variables
  * x = 4
  * y = x+1
  * What does y equal?
  * datafile_name = "precipitation.csv"
* Loops
  * Do something for every record in my data
* Conditionals
  * Sometimes you don't want to do something for EVERY record
  * Do something ONLY if this condition is met
