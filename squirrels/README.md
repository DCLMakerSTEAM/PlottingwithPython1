# Dataset: NYC Park Squirrel Census

NYC took an [informal census](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/) of squirrels in some of its parks. They have made this [squirrel dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b97hxtsthbidl34/squirrel-data.csv?dl=0) available for [download](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/is2yaa5gz1of32xo1xwvd/squirrel-data.csv?rlkey=sao5wj2tqd98nzs6rsi5k7ot6&e=1&dl=1).

We do not know anything about this data, so let's just plot a few rows to see what we have.
* [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/): Hello! I would like to graph some location data on a map.
* Paste the header and the first 4 rows of sightings
* Copy the code into your own map_1.py file
* Run it
  * python3 map_1.py

That worked great and is just what we want to visualize. Now let's look at the entire file. Since the file could be extremely large we don't want to paste it all into ChatGPT. Instead, we want ChatGPT to write us a program that will read directly from the CSV file.
* [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/): Hello! I would like to graph some location data on a map. I have a CSV file that I would like to read the data from.
* Upload the CSV file
* Copy the code into your own map_2.py file
* Run it!
  * python3 map_2.py
* Oops... it crashes :(
* Fix it, run it, fix it, run it, ...
